*** Tracing function calls ***

playGame() is the over-arching function that starts the game once the start button is pressed

Right now, it calls...

(1) setupCitiesQueue() which ends calling no other functions or creating any event listeners.

(2) setupGameDisplay() which only needs to happen once at the beginning, it calls ----

----> displayQuestion() which ends calling no other function, but it creates a button "click" event listener to ------

------> evaluateAnswer() which has two routes:

(2a) if it's not the last round, it ends calling no other function but creates button "click" event to --------

--------> nextRound() which calls both displayQuestion() (which will loop on button clicks as seen above) and setupNewRound() which ends, not calling anything or creating any event listeners.

(2b) if it's the last round, it calls ------

-----------> showResults() which calls ----------

----------------> endGame() which **currently** sets a click event listener to playGame(), starting a new game with the same region



(3) setupNewRound() which ends, not calling anything or creating any event listeners. Has to happen this first time to setup the first round.







ideas
-------

- when answer is shown, remove pic from display. either put answer there or do something else
    * yea i think, display the answer where the pic is and just leave the "next city ->" button where it is now. maybe add something else to the right side as well
- "Which city is this?" should be above the picture rather than over to the right i think




box-shadow: 6px 2px 4px 4px rgba(160, 185, 253, 0.5), 7px 3px 4px 4px rgba(130, 155, 253, 0.5), 8px 4px 4px 4px rgba(100, 125, 253, 0.5),
  9px 5px 4px 4px rgba(70, 95, 253, 0.5), 10px 6px 4px 4px rgba(40, 65, 253, 0.5);


versions:
    just keep a global variable as a "pointer" to the current version of the game.
    with that i can basically modify anything in the game to a paritcular version, via switch statements and if/else statements




Left side:
    "More cities where those came from" play again
Right side:
    "Broaden your horizons"
    euorpe button
    worldwide button
